# ECE 6990: Masters Thesis Materials


This will be a portfolio of my work, code, etc. that I will use for my MSc Thesis @ Tennessee Tech. Note the repository name will change once a title and proposal are approved by my faculty committee. My thesis is at the intersection of optimal control, game-theoretic multi-agent systems, and reinforcement learning, with applications to pursuit–evasion and autonomous vehicles.
